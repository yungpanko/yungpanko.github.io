There has been interest from your office about building government as a platform in Massachusetts. In this letter, my aim is to provide clarity on what that might entail, where you should start and how this all should be governed. Embracing government as a platform is not an incremental change. It is a fundamental shift to the way that government data is managed and the way that digital services are offered. While not a path free of issues and headaches, this journey will result in services that better serve the needs of Massachusetts.

Government as a platform is an idea first expressed by technology writer, Tim O'Reilly, in [this 2011 article](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/INOV_a_00056). O'Reilly makes the argument that government data should be treated as an asset and that investment in the infrastructure connecting that asset to the the public will lead to greater innovation capacity from both government itself and the public. Moreover, the investment that O'Reilly calls for should be guided by "platform thinking." This means establishing a set of standards around an asset that allow for applications and services to built on top of it. These "extensions" of the platform will be better government services, made possible by easier-to-use data, but also radically innovative applications developed by the public.

Building government as a platform in Massachusetts would mean moving to a "[service culture](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/60993/Martha_20Lane_20Fox_s_20letter_20to_20Francis_20Maude_2014th_20Oct_202010.pdf)," where by 1) a portfolio of services can be accessed through a **single portal**, supported by all departments but managed by a **single authority** and 2) establishing a single authority responsible for designing the **architecture and standards** for government data. 

### A single portal

Massachusetts citizens should not have to face different user experiences across one government. Right now, [Mass.gov](mass.gov) is a bloated portal connecting our citizens to many different departments, all offering different experiences. Most of the services we offer operate on an island. They warehouse their own data and rely on duplicative IT infrastructure.

It is not enough that we are offering these services online. We can make them cheaper, easier-to-build and easier for our citizens to use. This starts with making Mass.gov the single portal to all government hosted and supported services. Regardless of the department responsible for the content or application, a shared set of design principle should rule. Our citizens should recognize a familiar look and feel whenever using a Massachusetts digital service. 

We don't need to reinvent the wheel every time a department wants to create a service. Moving to a system of shared IT services, we can reduce the burden that departments face in building services. At the same time, we can drastically cut vendor costs and increase the speed at which applications can be developed. Universal design principles and shared IT services are two of the most important pillars of a government platform. The single most important pillar, yet, is data.

### Architecture and standards for government data

Just as much IT infrastructure is duplicative, so is much of the data collected by our government. This is necessary in a world where each department, and often each service, operates in its own sandbox. There are universal benefits that come with moving towards a [single source of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth) but the stakes for government are much higher. In order for a department to build a new service today, they must spend enormous amounts of time and money working to integrate data from a different system, if they can even get access to the other systems. This friction slows development cycles and bloats budgets.

A more efficient way to share data using [APIs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danwoods/2011/12/15/explaining-the-api-revolution-to-your-ceo/#2b9f7dee1179) can solve these problems but you first need someone to establish some standards. One of the primary responsibilities of digital services should be to set and maintain these standards so that data is usable and transferrable. Once data is made available, the process for integration into a new services should require no formal approvals. Making data more accessible can empower departments and their vendors to employ agile development processes, increasing the speed to market and citizen engagement. 

### Where to start

A fair question to ask is where to start and I have two recommendations. Given that one of the key benefits of government as a platform is the reduction of duplication, I suggest starting with **citizen records**. I'm talking about names, addresses, birth dates and other information that is likely to be duplicated across systems. A useful user application to build on top of these records is a single sign on platform across all government departments. This way, citizens can use the same credentials to log on for the entire portfolio of services. The UK Government Digital Services had success integrating this with third party banks and mail carriers.

Another logical place to start is with the services that are currently used the most. Right now on the mass.gov website, we list "featured services" and "popular searches." Redesigning these high traffic services could go a long way in gaining the buy in and trust from all government departments. Moreover, this buy in is essential to the success of government as a service for Massachusetts and a thoughtful governance structure will be necessary to achieve it.  

### Governance

I mentioned above that digital services should be responsible for developing the standards for government data. If you accept O'Reilly's argument about the importance of government data as an asset, you must also recognize the power in controlling that asset. As [David Eaves](https://medium.com/@daeaves) warns, "whoever controls the databases controls the government." Thus, I would recommend establishing digital services as an independent executive office separate from the other IT functions housed in [EOTSS](https://www.mass.gov/topics/executive-office-of-technology-services-and-security).

I make this suggestion for two reasons. First, establishing an independent executive office, with the head of digital services reporting directly to the governor, will give the team the authority necessary to hold other departments to their standards. The UK Government Digital Services team held the power to approve IT vendor contracts. This power brought them animosity from various government departments but proved critical in their rollout. That may not be necessary in the case of Massachusetts state but the lesson about the importance of independent power should hold.

The independence of digital service is also necessary to prevent political actors within government from blocking the transfer or uses of data. Moving from the isolated ecosystems of today towards the open innovation that comes with government as a platform is political in its own right. Standing for innovation means establishing a governance structure where data cannot be ransomed or withheld for political gain.
