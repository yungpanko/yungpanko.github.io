Back when I was working for J.P. Morgan, I used to help organize conferences that we put on for our financial advisor clients. Much of the content was macro insights from our chief economists but in the last few years, we started to talk about privacy and cyber security. The "aha moment" of our privacy session was always when our CTO would ask the audience to pull out their iPhones. Things have changed in iOS since then but in iOS 12, you can go to **["Settings" => "Privacy" => "Location Services" => "System Services" => "Significant Locations"]** to get to something that looks like this.

Click into one of those cities. I scrolled down to Cambridge, Massachusetts to find something that looks like this.

At this point, most of our audience, many of them business owners who considered themselves well versed in technology, would be in shock. How could it be that you've been allowing iPhone to not only track your geographic coordinates, but also map them to recognizable locations and pass that data along to other services without even knowing? Well the truth is that you probably consented to this at some point. Maybe it was when you bought your very first iPhone and, in a rush of excitement, failed to realize that you had just authorized location services. 

Our CTO would end his session with guidance about turning off this feature. And although I had watched this exact session several times, along with the audience's painful reaction, I never once turned the "Significant Locations" feature off. Had you asked me years ago about this, I would have struggled to articulate my defense. I was just as creeped out as the financial advisors the first time I saw this but afterwards, my awareness made it feel like a choice. After getting a little a smarter about privacy in recent months, I think there is a through-line from this defense to what I now believe to be the major issue with data privacy and services: **consent**.

On top of allowing my iPhone to track my location data for use in it's own apps (Maps, Calendar, and Photos are named under the "Significant Locations" description), I allow dozens of other apps to use this data as well. For the majority of these services, I am only authorizing them to use my location when I am using the app. But for a handful, the location data is set to "Always," giving these third-parties the same data that Apple collects. I've notably got Facebook set to "Never" but that's worth it's own blog post.

One of the services where I have location services set to "Always" is Foursquare. I've been using Foursquare since the days of "checking in" to your favorite coffee shop (and yes, those days are gone if you haven't checked). Modern Foursquare is a useful tool for navigating cities on the fly. Think of it like Yelp but rather than reading through paragraph-length zero-star reviews, you can get quick and useful information, like the wifi password. 

Like Apple, Foursquare is constantly collecting my location data, guessing if I am visiting a restaurant, a store or just my house. Foursquare monetizes this data in three key ways: [licensing, targeting and foot-traffic analytics](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/021516/inside-look-foursquares-business-model.asp). Data from my interactions on Foursquare is sold to search engines who want better location specific search data, marketers who want to send location specific ads, and developers looking to understand how many people might walk in front of a new storefront. And although I see none of this profit for handing over my data, at least I can find the wifi passwords.

Joking aside, I'm comfortable with Foursquare's collection and use of my data **specifically because I knowingly consented to it**. Learning about all the ways that they monetize my data doesn't rattle me the way that learning about my iPhone's "Significant Locations" feature did. In my mind, it is debatable whether I was ever able to give informed consent to Apple to use my location data.

In the most dire scenarios, location data from your mobile device would be of great importance. In her book, _"[Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest](https://smile.amazon.com/Twitter-Tear-Gas-Fragility-Networked/dp/0300234171/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)_,"Zeynep Tufecki explains how services like Twitter were used during the Arab Spring to organize and distribute resources. What if a state had the same data that Foursquare has? Security forces would be able to preempt any organizing simply by monitoring for irregular foot-traffic.

These extremes point to the importance of consent and control. Location data can make services better and, in theory, our lives easier (I really hate asking my barista for the wifi password). Moreover, when collection occurs without express consent or awareness, people are vulnerable. Our devices can become our downfall. The rise of smart cities, where data is constantly collected without citizen consent, should raise the same concerns. We're now living in a world where (literally!) our every move is data. When there is no longer a consensual exchange at work, we will have truly infringed on our rights to privacy.
