Secretary Sawhney, 

The situation in our country is worsening. Rumors spread through Facebook and WhatsApp have lead to the deaths of now more than 20 innocent people. To aid your response to this urgent matter, I have summarized your options. I should make clear my belief that our best response involves a combination of a social media campaign and engagement with Facebook. The other options, while effective in remedying the current situation, introduce structural risks to our ability to maintain democracy.  

The threat posed by technologies such as WhatsApp and Facebook stretches beyond the present situation. Conflicts that would otherwise mature into civil unrest can instead turn massively violent. In [Sri Lanka](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/world/asia/facebook-sri-lanka-riots.html), these apps were also at the center of riots and lynchings, with tensions exacerbated across ethnic and religious fault lines. Facebook failed to respond to government requests for intervention. Similar complaints about Facebook's failure to intervene has arisen out of the situation in [Myanmar](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html). **What we should gather is that this is not an issue that technology companies will solve for us.** 

## At a high level, our response options are:
*   censorship
*   surveillance 
*   a social media counter-campaign 
*   direct engagement with Facebook 

### Censorship

The western press has been critical of our use of [temporary internet shutdowns during peiods of unrest](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghabahree/2018/11/12/india-leads-the-world-in-the-number-of-internet-shutdowns-report/#46da1ca83cdb). At the same time, many of us in government see this as an effective tool at preventing the types of atrocities taking place in Myanmar. But while temporary shutdowns may seem extreme to some, we have resisted blocking access to Facebook altogether.

If we deem that these technologies pose more harm than benefit, it is within our authority to restrict access. Ideally, doing so would strengthen our media organizations, whose power to influence has fallen with the rise of social media. It is much easier to deal with untruths coming from a centralized media organization versus those on distributed social media platforms.

The downside to censorship is not only negativity from the western press. As was the [case with rule 66A](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/24/india-supreme-court-strikes-down-internet-censorship-law), this practice is likely to be challenged under freedom of speech laws. The courts may side with citizens arguing in favor of their rights to public outlets such as Facebook and WhatsApp. Even without a decisive opinion, we should expect a reaction from the public. It would not be difficult to imagine this reaction to be one of distrust and resentment. **With public confidence being such a pillar to democracy, I cannot recommend undertaking such measures to censor these platforms altogether.**

### Surveillance

The velocity of information on social platforms is what makes these crises possible. Law enforcement is unable to preempt the organization of violent mobs. With better surveillance, we could keep forces current and increase our capacity to preserve peace.

Where censorship awakens the issue of freedom of speech, surveillance awakens the issue of privacy. Consider the nature of social media where communications can take the shape of large groups down to direct messaging. At the higher level, arguments likening groups to the public square can be applied to exempt from the breach of any privacy rights. But at the level of direct messaging, there is no way around the infringement on the rights of our citizens.

### Social Media Counter-Campaign

As I mentioned above, social media has weakened our media's capacity to influence. Word-of-mouth and viral content are as more credible than mass media. Government could play a role in the information exchange that takes place online. Using these platforms to spread official government messages could help to mitigate the damage done by false narratives. 

Instead of censoring or watching over social media, we can get involved. **With our official government accounts, we can provide the public with the most up-to-date and accurate information that we have.** We can counter false narratives with active social media presence.

Embracing social media has the added benefit of sidestepping concerns of privacy and free speech. 

### Direct Engagement with Facebook

The last strategy, and the strategy with the highest long-term potential, is partnering with the platforms. In the cases referenced at the top of this letter, this strategy failed. Facebook's response to government requests was either inadequate or indifferent. **Recognizing that scale is of interest to platforms like Facebook, the threat of censorship should bring them to the bargaining table.**

Our asks should include more moderators in the range of languages native to our country, but also more fundamental changes to the platform itself. Most specific in my mind is countering the dynamics that allow dangerous messages to go viral. This could be done by giving more weight to updates from direct contacts and media organizations rather than popular messages from second or third party connections. The culmination of technical tweaks like this can, over the long run, yield social media platforms that work better for the people of India.

My recommendation is to focus on the latter two responses, whereby we can embrace these platforms and work directly with the companies to improve them.
