        <h1>4 things i learned toying around with nested resources in Rails</h1>
        <p>13 Jun 2017</p>

        <p>Let’s table set — what is a nested resource?</p>

<p>I’m referring to a type of routing mechanism available to use in Ruby on Rails. The <em>‘resources’</em> syntax is a useful way to have Rails generate each of the CRUD routes for you. Take a look below.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/nested1.png" alt="config/routes.rb in my rails application" />
<em>config/routes.rb in my rails application</em></p>

<p>Here, in my <em>config/routes.rb</em> file, I am using the <em>‘resources’</em> keyword to draw routes for my <em>‘Artist’</em> model. Now, when I run <em>‘rake routes,’</em> I can see that the following routes have been generated for me.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/nested2.png" alt="‘rake routes’ returns the full list of rails routes to your terminal — ‘rake’ is a ruby gem that is required for this call" />
<em>‘rake routes’ returns the full list of rails routes to your terminal — ‘rake’ is a ruby gem that is required for this call</em></p>

<p>If i want to expand my model to include songs, I have some choices to make. I could have Rails generate a suite of routes beginning with <em>‘/songs’</em> for me, just as I have done with artists OR I could choose to nest these routes underneath those that I have already drawn for artists. The latter would look like this.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/nested3.png" alt="Here, I am passing my songs resources in as a block underneath ‘artists’" />
<em>Here, I am passing my songs resources in as a block underneath ‘artists’</em></p>

<p>The nested approach provides me with the following list of routes.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/nested4.png" alt="routes" /></p>

<p>And here lies the first thing that I learned about nested routes.</p>

<h2 id="1-the-id-is-appended-with-the-name-of-previous-model-at-each-level-of-nesting">#1 The :id is appended with the name of previous model at each level of nesting.</h2>

<p>My <em>‘/artists/:id’</em> convention becomes <em>‘/artists/:artist_id/songs/:id’</em> once I navigate into my song routes. Why is this syntax change important? Now when my application receives a request to any of the actions defined in my SongsController, an artist ID is passed to me in the format of <em>‘params[:artist_id].’</em></p>

<p>If I want my <em>songs#index</em> action to display a collection of songs that belong to the artist that I am navigating under, I will need to pass <em>‘params[:artist_id]’</em> in as an argument to stipulate that I only want songs from the artist who’s ID matches (see below).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/nested5.png" alt="app/controllers/songs_controller.rb" /></p>

<h2 id="2-the-form_for-rails-helper-method-requires-you-to-pass-in-an-object-for-each-level-of-nesting">#2 The ‘form_for’ Rails helper method requires you to pass in an object for each level of nesting.</h2>

<p>Rails comes pre-loaded with a bunch of different useful helper methods, one of which is <em>‘form_for,’</em> which assists with the routing for model-based form input.</p>

<p>Typically, I would use an instance of a model as the sole argument in a form. When we create a new song, with the models outlined earlier, what we are really doing is creating a new song object that belongs to an artist object. Therefore, without letting our <em>‘form_for’</em> element which artist we want to relate the form input to as well as which song, our ‘form_for’ model will not work. An example of my form for creating a new song is below.</p>

<h2 id="3-nesting-can-get-out-of-hand-very-quickly">#3 Nesting can get out of hand very quickly</h2>

<p>Simple demonstration: I’m going to add resources for <em>‘lyrics’</em> underneath my nested <em>‘songs’</em> resources.</p>

<h2 id="4-nesting-best-practices">#4 Nesting best practices</h2>

<p>From <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2007/2/5/nesting-resources" title="Nesting resources">Jamis Buck’s blog post</a> (also referenced in the Rails guide):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Resources should never be nested more than 1 level deep.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Buck’s blog post suggests an advanced method for keeping your routes and URLs from getting out of control but I wanted to highlight two quick ways that you can refactor your code.</p>

<h3 id="shallow-nesting">Shallow nesting</h3>
<p>Adding the <em>‘shallow: true’</em> parameter to your nested resource will define routes at the base level, <em>‘/songs/’</em>, for four of our RESTful routes — <em>show</em>, <em>edit</em>, <em>update</em> and <em>destroy</em>, while leaving the remaining routes — <em>index, new, create</em>— at the nested level. So how is this useful to us?</p>

<p>In my model, with artists and songs, we are now able to use the routes starting with <em>‘/songs/:id’</em> to view or modify existing songs on an individual basis. Recall that songs belong to artists, so upon creation, we still need to initialize a song with an artist relationship. However, once a song is created, it doesn’t matter to artist relationship if we would like to edit or delete it. And so, we don’t need to follow a lengthy route, such as <em>‘/artists/:artist_id/songs/:id/edit’</em> to make our changes.</p>

<h3 id="collectionmember-blocks">Collection/Member blocks</h3>

<p>While it would not help to simplify my model, collection and member blocks can be used to create routes with specific dependencies.</p>
