&lt;p&gt;The situation in our country is worsening. Rumors spread through Facebook and WhatsApp have lead to the deaths of now more than 20 innocent people. To aid your response to this urgent matter, I have summarized your options. I should make clear my belief that our best response involves a combination of a social media campaign and engagement with Facebook. The other options, while effective in remedying the current situation, introduce structural risks to our ability to maintain democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat posed by technologies such as WhatsApp and Facebook stretches beyond the present situation. Conflicts that would otherwise mature into civil unrest can instead turn massively violent. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/world/asia/facebook-sri-lanka-riots.html&quot;&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;, these apps were also at the center of riots and lynchings, with tensions exacerbated across ethnic and religious fault lines. Facebook failed to respond to government requests for intervention. Similar complaints about Facebook’s failure to intervene has arisen out of the situation in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html&quot;&gt;Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;What we should gather is that this is not an issue that technology companies will solve for us.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;at-a-high-level-our-response-optionsare&quot;&gt;At a high level, our response options are:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;censorship&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;surveillance &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a social media counter-campaign &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;direct engagement with Facebook &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;censorship&quot;&gt;Censorship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The western press has been critical of our use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghabahree/2018/11/12/india-leads-the-world-in-the-number-of-internet-shutdowns-report/#46da1ca83cdb&quot;&gt;temporary internet shutdowns during peiods of unrest&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, many of us in government see this as an effective tool at preventing the types of atrocities taking place in Myanmar. But while temporary shutdowns may seem extreme to some, we have resisted blocking access to Facebook altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we deem that these technologies pose more harm than benefit, it is within our authority to restrict access. Ideally, doing so would strengthen our media organizations, whose power to influence has fallen with the rise of social media. It is much easier to deal with untruths coming from a centralized media organization versus those on distributed social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside to censorship is not only negativity from the western press. As was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/24/india-supreme-court-strikes-down-internet-censorship-law&quot;&gt;case with rule 66A&lt;/a&gt;, this practice is likely to be challenged under freedom of speech laws. The courts may side with citizens arguing in favor of their rights to public outlets such as Facebook and WhatsApp. Even without a decisive opinion, we should expect a reaction from the public. It would not be difficult to imagine this reaction to be one of distrust and resentment. &lt;strong&gt;With public confidence being such a pillar to democracy, I cannot recommend undertaking such measures to censor these platforms altogether.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;surveillance&quot;&gt;Surveillance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The velocity of information on social platforms is what makes these crises possible. Law enforcement is unable to preempt the organization of violent mobs. With better surveillance, we could keep forces current and increase our capacity to preserve peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where censorship awakens the issue of freedom of speech, surveillance awakens the issue of privacy. Consider the nature of social media where communications can take the shape of large groups down to direct messaging. At the higher level, arguments likening groups to the public square can be applied to exempt from the breach of any privacy rights. But at the level of direct messaging, there is no way around the infringement on the rights of our citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;social-media-counter-campaign&quot;&gt;Social Media Counter-Campaign&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, social media has weakened our media’s capacity to influence. Word-of-mouth and viral content are as more credible than mass media. Government could play a role in the information exchange that takes place online. Using these platforms to spread official government messages could help to mitigate the damage done by false narratives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of censoring or watching over social media, we can get involved. &lt;strong&gt;With our official government accounts, we can provide the public with the most up-to-date and accurate information that we have.&lt;/strong&gt; We can counter false narratives with active social media presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embracing social media has the added benefit of sidestepping concerns of privacy and free speech. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;direct-engagement-with-facebook&quot;&gt;Direct Engagement with Facebook&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last strategy, and the strategy with the highest long-term potential, is partnering with the platforms. In the cases referenced at the top of this letter, this strategy failed. Facebook’s response to government requests was either inadequate or indifferent. &lt;strong&gt;Recognizing that scale is of interest to platforms like Facebook, the threat of censorship should bring them to the bargaining table.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our asks should include more moderators in the range of languages native to our country, but also more fundamental changes to the platform itself. Most specific in my mind is countering the dynamics that allow dangerous messages to go viral. This could be done by giving more weight to updates from direct contacts and media organizations rather than popular messages from second or third party connections. The culmination of technical tweaks like this can, over the long run, yield social media platforms that work better for the people of India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation is to focus on the latter two responses, whereby we can embrace these platforms and work directly with the companies to improve them.&lt;/p&gt;

Morgan, I used to help organize conferences that we put on for our financial advisor clients. Much of the content was macro insights from our chief economists but in the last few years, we started to talk about privacy and cyber security. The “aha moment” of our privacy session was always when our CTO would ask the audience to pull out their iPhones. Things have changed in iOS since then but in iOS 12, you can go to &lt;strong&gt;[“Settings” =&amp;gt; “Privacy” =&amp;gt; “Location Services” =&amp;gt; “System Services” =&amp;gt; “Significant Locations”]&lt;/strong&gt; to get to something that looks like this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/location-services.png&quot; alt=&quot;location-services&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click into one of those cities. I scrolled down to Cambridge, Massachusetts to find something that looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/location-services-cambridge.png&quot; alt=&quot;location-services-cambridge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, most of our audience, many of them business owners who considered themselves well versed in technology, would be in shock. How could it be that you’ve been allowing iPhone to not only track your geographic coordinates, but also map them to recognizable locations and pass that data along to other services without even knowing? Well the truth is that you probably consented to this at some point. Maybe it was when you bought your very first iPhone and, in a rush of excitement, failed to realize that you had just authorized location services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our CTO would end his session with guidance about turning off this feature. And although I had watched this exact session several times, along with the audience’s painful reaction, I never once turned the “Significant Locations” feature off. Had you asked me years ago about this, I would have struggled to articulate my defense. I was just as creeped out as the financial advisors the first time I saw this but afterwards, my awareness made it feel like a choice. After getting a little a smarter about privacy in recent months, I think there is a through-line from this defense to what I now believe to be the major issue with data privacy and services: &lt;strong&gt;consent&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of allowing my iPhone to track my location data for use in it’s own apps (Maps, Calendar, and Photos are named under the “Significant Locations” description), I allow dozens of other apps to use this data as well. For the majority of these services, I am only authorizing them to use my location when I am using the app. But for a handful, the location data is set to “Always,” giving these third-parties the same data that Apple collects. I’ve notably got Facebook set to “Never” but that’s worth it’s own blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the services where I have location services set to “Always” is Foursquare. I’ve been using Foursquare since the days of “checking in” to your favorite coffee shop (and yes, those days are gone if you haven’t checked). Modern Foursquare is a useful tool for navigating cities on the fly. Think of it like Yelp but rather than reading through paragraph-length zero-star reviews, you can get quick and useful information, like the wifi password. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Apple, Foursquare is constantly collecting my location data, guessing if I am visiting a restaurant, a store or just my house. Foursquare monetizes this data in three key ways: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/021516/inside-look-foursquares-business-model.asp&quot;&gt;licensing, targeting and foot-traffic analytics&lt;/a&gt;. Data from my interactions on Foursquare is sold to search engines who want better location specific search data, marketers who want to send location specific ads, and developers looking to understand how many people might walk in front of a new storefront. And although I see none of this profit for handing over my data, at least I can find the wifi passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joking aside, I’m comfortable with Foursquare’s collection and use of my data &lt;strong&gt;specifically because I knowingly consented to it&lt;/strong&gt;. Learning about all the ways that they monetize my data doesn’t rattle me the way that learning about my iPhone’s “Significant Locations” feature did. In my mind, it is debatable whether I was ever able to give informed consent to Apple to use my location data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the most dire scenarios, location data from your mobile device would be of great importance. In her book, &lt;em&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.com/Twitter-Tear-Gas-Fragility-Networked/dp/0300234171/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=&amp;amp;sr=&quot;&gt;Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,”Zeynep Tufecki explains how services like Twitter were used during the Arab Spring to organize and distribute resources. What if a state had the same data that Foursquare has? Security forces would be able to preempt any organizing simply by monitoring for irregular foot-traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These extremes point to the importance of consent and control. Location data can make services better and, in theory, our lives easier (I really hate asking my barista for the wifi password). Moreover, when collection occurs without express consent or awareness, people are vulnerable. Our devices can become our downfall. The rise of smart cities, where data is constantly collected without citizen consent, should raise the same concerns. We’re now living in a world where (literally!) our every move is data. When there is no longer a consensual exchange at work, we will have truly infringed on our rights to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

Although I would recommend that our community take advantage of this free software, I am cautious to mandate it. Doing so would increase the institution’s dependency on Lastpass and could increase our cyber vulnerabilities. From my perspective, password managers bring benefits to individual users but open new avenues of risk for institutions like HKS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a recent session on cybersecurity, I was introduced to the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/assessing-your-risks&quot;&gt;threat modeling&lt;/a&gt;. In short, threat modeling is a framework for diagnosing what your at-risk assets are along with how and why attackers might threaten them. During this session, a group of us were asked us to prioritize the risks that an adversary’s likely resources might pose to us. Surprising to me was how fast we reached consensus on what we thought were the top two risks: insider knowledge and insider capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s good reason for this. Getting an inside look or, even worse, complete control over a system can be as simple as getting someone’s password. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cso.com.au/mediareleases/29642/hacked-passwords-cause-81-of-data-breaches/&quot;&gt;Some reports&lt;/a&gt; show that up to 81% of security breaches are due to compromised passwords. This includes headline-grabbing high-profile attacks such as the one on the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM). In this case, attackers were able to obtain &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/10/inside-cyberattack-shocked-us-government/&quot;&gt;“the single credential necessary to compromise OPM”&lt;/a&gt; via trial-and-error. These attackers made it off with the personal records of over 4.2 million people by guessing what were likely weak passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first benefits a new user to a password manager will discover is the ability to maintain complex passwords. It has become common knowledge that more complex passwords, using a combination of letters, numbers and symbols, are harder to hack. Yet, every organization is likely to have people using credentials such as “password” or “123456”. Understandably, people would struggle to remember a password like “t6jML=Dh”fF%!YTuFm.” Even the most well meaning users might resort to writing this down  on a post-it in their office or storing it (unsecured) on their phone. Password managers solve this problem by asking you to only remember one secure passphrase, which acts as your key to all your complex passwords. As a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dashlane.com/&quot;&gt;Dashlane&lt;/a&gt; user, I’m used to my password manager all but yelling at me when I try to save a new password that’s too simple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another valid concern is that a hacked password from one service could be used, with the same email address or username, to access different services. A student using the same password on Twitter as they do to log onto Canvas should concern us. Password managers have two solutions for this. Dashlane monitors for password duplication and will alert me when I’m using the same password, even if it’s a complex one, across services. Remember, the goal is for me to remember only one “master” password that links to a unique password for every unique service. After switching all my passwords over to Dashlane, I couldn’t even begin to guess what my credentials for Twitter are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second security measure that I want to mention is breach monitoring. Password managers like Lastpass, 1Password, and Dashlane alert users (and prompt them to change their passwords) as soon as they know that a breach has occurred. This removes the burden on the user to keep up to date with the security news and can help users get ahead of breaches where their data could be used to access other services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as I’ve mentioned, there are benefits to individuals in using password managers. The question of mandating Lastpass, however, puts into focus the institutional perspective. The threat that weak passwords pose to our systems has largely been neutralized. The two solutions to thank for this are strong password guidelines and multi-factor authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On strong password guidelines, I am referring to the requirements for letters, numbers and special characters. This prevents users from using credentials such as “password” when accessing HKS services. More powerful, yet, is multi-factor authentication, which requires confirmation on a second device upon logging in. An attacker would need to have access to your phone or tablet to be able to break into your account. OPM was too late in adopting multi-factor authentication, which could have prevented their attack. Even with guessing the right passwords, their assailants wouldn’t have been able to make it pass the security gate. Adding a password manager on top of a stack that includes strong password guidelines and multi-factor authentication has limited upside. The same loopholes (and more) are being addressed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, mandating a password manager could increase your risks. Upon introducing someone to any password manager, you can expect to hear one critical question. What happens when my password manager gets hacked? In this easy-to-imagine nightmare scenario, an attacker would now have access to all your passwords. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gizmodo.com/lastpass-defender-of-our-passwords-just-got-hacked-1711475964&quot;&gt;And it’s happened before&lt;/a&gt;. But as I’ve discussed here, the benefits to using a password manager are likely to outweigh the potential consequences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an institution, however, we must consider whether that holds true. Mandating Lastpass would create a dependency. All users at HKS would need to store their passwords in one place. This increases the attack surface here at HKS. While multi-factor authentication would still function as a gate, an attack on Lastpass would drastically increase the odds that an attacker could penetrate our network. And the motivations to carry out an attack on Lastpass may increase under a policy where the software is required. Someone who wants to break into HKS may find hacking into Lastpass an easier route than going directly at our services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing, I want to reaffirm my recommendation that students and staff download Lastpass, or another password manager, and start using it immediately. Increasing the complexity of your passwords and staying on top of breaches are necessary security measures in today’s world. Institutions like HKS should continue to enforce strong password guidelines and require multi-factor authentication. These measures greatly improve our security by protecting our most vulnerable resource, our people. Mandating Lastpass is, for me, an unnecessary step that could bring about new difficulties. I remain open to this conversation in the future and invite my colleagues to present alternate views.&lt;/p&gt;

In this letter, my aim is to provide clarity on what that might entail, where you should start and how this all should be governed. Embracing government as a platform is not an incremental change. It is a fundamental shift to the way that government data is managed and the way that digital services are offered. While not a path free of issues and headaches, this journey will result in services that better serve the needs of Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government as a platform is an idea first expressed by technology writer, Tim O’Reilly, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/INOV_a_00056&quot;&gt;this 2011 article&lt;/a&gt;. O’Reilly makes the argument that government data should be treated as an asset and that investment in the infrastructure connecting that asset to the the public will lead to greater innovation capacity from both government itself and the public. Moreover, the investment that O’Reilly calls for should be guided by “platform thinking.” This means establishing a set of standards around an asset that allow for applications and services to built on top of it. These “extensions” of the platform will be better government services, made possible by easier-to-use data, but also radically innovative applications developed by the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building government as a platform in Massachusetts would mean moving to a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/60993/Martha_20Lane_20Fox_s_20letter_20to_20Francis_20Maude_2014th_20Oct_202010.pdf&quot;&gt;service culture&lt;/a&gt;,” where by 1) a portfolio of services can be accessed through a &lt;strong&gt;single portal&lt;/strong&gt;, supported by all departments but managed by a &lt;strong&gt;single authority&lt;/strong&gt; and 2) establishing a single authority responsible for designing the &lt;strong&gt;architecture and standards&lt;/strong&gt; for government data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-single-portal&quot;&gt;A single portal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts citizens should not have to face different user experiences across one government. Right now, &lt;a href=&quot;mass.gov&quot;&gt;Mass.gov&lt;/a&gt; is a bloated portal connecting our citizens to many different departments, all offering different experiences. Most of the services we offer operate on an island. They warehouse their own data and rely on duplicative IT infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/drivers_license_GaaP.png&quot; alt=&quot;renew drivers license&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Portal for renewing your drivers license&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jury_duty_GaaP.png&quot; alt=&quot;jury duty&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Portal for responding to jury duty. Completely Different Branding and experience!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not enough that we are offering these services online. We can make them cheaper, easier-to-build and easier for our citizens to use. This starts with making Mass.gov the single portal to all government hosted and supported services. Regardless of the department responsible for the content or application, a shared set of design principle should rule. Our citizens should recognize a familiar look and feel whenever using a Massachusetts digital service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t need to reinvent the wheel every time a department wants to create a service. Moving to a system of shared IT services, we can reduce the burden that departments face in building services. At the same time, we can drastically cut vendor costs and increase the speed at which applications can be developed. Universal design principles and shared IT services are two of the most important pillars of a government platform. The single most important pillar, yet, is data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;architecture-and-standards-for-government-data&quot;&gt;Architecture and standards for government data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as much IT infrastructure is duplicative, so is much of the data collected by our government. This is necessary in a world where each department, and often each service, operates in its own sandbox. There are universal benefits that come with moving towards a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth&quot;&gt;single source of truth&lt;/a&gt; but the stakes for government are much higher. In order for a department to build a new service today, they must spend enormous amounts of time and money working to integrate data from a different system, if they can even get access to the other systems. This friction slows development cycles and bloats budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more efficient way to share data using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/danwoods/2011/12/15/explaining-the-api-revolution-to-your-ceo/#2b9f7dee1179&quot;&gt;APIs&lt;/a&gt; can solve these problems but you first need someone to establish some standards. One of the primary responsibilities of digital services should be to set and maintain these standards so that data is usable and transferrable. Once data is made available, the process for integration into a new services should require no formal approvals. Making data more accessible can empower departments and their vendors to employ agile development processes, increasing the speed to market and citizen engagement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-to-start&quot;&gt;Where to start&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fair question to ask is where to start and I have two recommendations. Given that one of the key benefits of government as a platform is the reduction of duplication, I suggest starting with &lt;strong&gt;citizen records&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m talking about names, addresses, birth dates and other information that is likely to be duplicated across systems. A useful user application to build on top of these records is a single sign on platform across all government departments. This way, citizens can use the same credentials to log on for the entire portfolio of services. The UK Government Digital Services had success integrating this with third party banks and mail carriers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/eaves_GaaP.png&quot; alt=&quot;single sign on&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@daeaves&quot;&gt;David Eaves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another logical place to start is with the services that are currently used the most. Right now on the mass.gov website, we list “featured services” and “popular searches.” Redesigning these high traffic services could go a long way in gaining the buy in and trust from all government departments. Moreover, this buy in is essential to the success of government as a service for Massachusetts and a thoughtful governance structure will be necessary to achieve it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;governance&quot;&gt;Governance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned above that digital services should be responsible for developing the standards for government data. If you accept O’Reilly’s argument about the importance of government data as an asset, you must also recognize the power in controlling that asset. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@daeaves&quot;&gt;David Eaves&lt;/a&gt; warns, “whoever controls the databases controls the government.” Thus, I would recommend establishing digital services as an independent executive office separate from the other IT functions housed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mass.gov/topics/executive-office-of-technology-services-and-security&quot;&gt;EOTSS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make this suggestion for two reasons. First, establishing an independent executive office, with the head of digital services reporting directly to the governor, will give the team the authority necessary to hold other departments to their standards. The UK Government Digital Services team held the power to approve IT vendor contracts. This power brought them animosity from various government departments but proved critical in their rollout. That may not be necessary in the case of Massachusetts state but the lesson about the importance of independent power should hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The independence of digital service is also necessary to prevent political actors within government from blocking the transfer or uses of data. Moving from the isolated ecosystems of today towards the open innovation that comes with government as a platform is political in its own right. Standing for innovation means establishing a governance structure where data cannot be ransomed or withheld for political gain.&lt;/p&gt;

In this letter, my aim is to provide clarity on what that might entail, where you should start and how this all should be governed. Embracing government as a platform is not an incremental change. It is a fundamental shift to the way that government data is managed and the way that digital services are offered. While not a path free of issues and headaches, this journey will result in services that better serve the needs of Massachusetts.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">digital HKS: Redefining Failure with The Lean Startup</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/09/17/redefining-failure-lean-startup.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="digital HKS: Redefining Failure with The Lean Startup" /><published>2018-09-17T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-09-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/09/17/redefining-failure-lean-startup</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/09/17/redefining-failure-lean-startup.html">&lt;p&gt;Last fall, I had an idea to build a real estate crowdfunding startup. Along with another MIT student, I  applied for DesignX, an accelerator program based out of the School of Architecture + Planning. Only four months after starting our venture, I left the team. Frustrated with the pace of progress, I forced the team to take a trip to New York to hear from some potential users. After returning with many of my assumptions invalidated, I wanted to move on. I consider this experience a failure because I failed to lead my team down a more &lt;a href=&quot;https://smile.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898/ref=sr_1_1%3Fie=UTF8%26qid=1450159620%26sr=8-1%26keywords=lean+startup&quot;&gt;hypothesis-driven path (Eric Ries, &lt;em&gt;The Lean Startup&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;. We spent months ironing out the details of our business model before actually talking to customers. Our most critical assumption went untested for the entirety of our venture. It was only once we presented our model to users that we realized that we had no business at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team set out to build a platform to connect investors and developers within a community. I want to differentiate my use of &lt;em&gt;platform&lt;/em&gt; from the way that &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@daeaves&quot;&gt;David Eaves&lt;/a&gt;, director of digital HKS at Harvard Kennedy School, uses it to describe a set of rules and resources for others to build services on top off. We wanted a closed and controlled ecosystem to pool and distribute investment dollars. I assumed that cheaper financing for projects that already had community support would be a compelling proposition for developers. We built wireframes and mockups and I even started to code out an early version of this platform. We went back and forth over which city to start in and searched for project sites. The comfort of being in accelerator program with funding made me believe we were doing everything right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost none of our research had been with our potential users. In our platform model, we had two groups of users: investors and developers. To our credit, we spoke with a dozen or so people who expressed interest in signing up on our platform as an investor. The other side of the market was completely unclear to us. When my comfort wore off, I started to have doubts. I wanted to learn from developers. What did they want? How could we design around them to make our platform a no-brainer to use? Our team booked a trip to New York, where we had a few real estate contacts, in search of these answers. We learned that developers, in large, didn’t want to work on someone else’s idea. Even cheap financing didn’t make these projects more attractive than one of their own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This insight was knowable from the beginning. A more hypothesis-driven process, like Reis talks about &lt;em&gt;in The Lean Startup&lt;/em&gt;, could have helped. We could have translated our assumptions into falsifiable hypotheses. For example, we could have exposed our assumption about our value proposition into a target number of developers that we could sign up. We wouldn’t need to build the platform to get these sign ups. A simple landing page with a description and a sign up form would be enough to gather this insight. We could also do this in person with a simple concept statement. Very early in this process, we could have surfaced the fact that our venture would not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to this invalidation, we could have adapted to what we learned. We felt exhausted and disillusioned by failure but a key component of a lean process is redefining failure. The goal is to learn and adapt. I am still confident in the consumer demand for smaller real estate investments. A lean process could generate new hypotheses about how to incentive a supply of investment opportunities. If our team were to generate more assumptions and test them, we could have increased our odds of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lean and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agilenutshell.com/agile_vs_waterfall&quot;&gt;agile methodology&lt;/a&gt; is often contrasted with the “waterfall” approach. Waterfall is common in the world of project management and emphasizes planning at the expense of testing. Testing comes last in the waterfall approach and is often where shortcuts are taken. While I have been a part of teams that employed waterfall, I am more susceptible to what Ries refers to as the “Just Do It” approach. This is, as the name suggests, when an entrepreneur expresses a bias for action at the expense of direction and goals. It is important for me to remember that structure is not my enemy. In fact, a little structure will empower my bias for action and give purpose to this activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lasting takeaway for me is that process is necessary to avoid, as Reis states, “offering a product that no one wants.” And who better to tell you what the consumer wants than the consumer themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ideo-and-the-colab-makeathon&quot;&gt;IDEO and the CoLab Makeathon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDEO is a global design consultancy that is famous for pioneering the use of design thinking methodology in product and service design. The firm opened the CoLab offices in Cambridge, MA and San Francisco, CA in partnership with a number of different organizations across finance, technology and education and thinks of these locations as an R&amp;amp;D network. The focus of the CoLab is around designing prototypes exploring emerging technologies. Before arriving, I was told to brush up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ideo-colab/quick-prototyping-tools-for-emerging-technologies-3fb56f62360a&quot;&gt;prototyping tools for blockchain and artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Makeathon is an event held annually at the CoLab. The CoLab team uses the Makeathon to evaluate candidates interested in their two-week January fellowship, an opportunity that attracts “makers” from the fields of business, engineering and design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-team&quot;&gt;My team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the Cambridge, MA CoLab office, the 60 or so of us were organized into 14 teams. My team members were a designer who also teaches human centered design in New York, an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering major at MIT, an MBA student at Columbia Business School, and an engineer working on computer vision. Clearly, I was in incredible company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/IDEO_team.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;team&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our team: Matt, Jennifer, Max, Wei and Me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ideating&quot;&gt;Ideating&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each team was handed a brief that described their task for the day. My team’s brief discussed exploring the balance between the utility of voice interfaces and privacy. It gave an example of a voice interface in an immigrations office, where natural language processing and artificial intelligence could certainly be useful but the privacy concerns around transmitting sensitive information are weighty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading through the brief, we spent the morning brainstorming and iterating on our ideas utilizing some of IDEO’s frameworks. We filled a poster board with sticky notes, which we rearranged multiple times as we worked to focus our ideas around one solution. Before breaking for lunch, we stumbled upon an idea to integrate a voice interface in a stuffed animal and grew excited. We knew that we wanted to build something for first responders or hospitals and had discussed different ways to make critical information collection easier for medical professionals. Our pivot came when considering how kids may be less likely to tell doctors (i.e. strangers) how they are feeling. Perhaps they would feel more comfortable talking to something that looks more like their furry friends at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/IDEO_brainstorming.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;brainstorming&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;An idea is born&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;making&quot;&gt;Making&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, we started prototyping. The IDEO staff were helpful in pointing us toward some tools that might be helpful for what we wanted to build. I knew that I wanted to dig into the technical side and spent some time working to get Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://dialogflow.com/&quot;&gt;Dialogflow&lt;/a&gt; up and running on my local machine while some of the other team members started to work on our presentation and business case. By mid afternoon, we had a breakthrough. We were able to write a speech script on my computer and get it to load on a borrowed Google Home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/IDEO_prototype.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;prototype2&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;IDEOg prototype&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;demo-time&quot;&gt;Demo Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day, we were able to demo a functional prototype that would respond to the user’s voice. We borrowed an old IDEO prototype, a cardboard dog named Bernard, and paired it with our Google Home to create IDEOg. Our product was aimed at hospitals who could provide kids who enter the waiting room an IDEOg. The product would ask the child some questions about how they are feeling and let them know that the doctor would soon be out to see them. The voice interface can overhear crucial details and communicate with the doctor, who is able to see a dashboard of data collected by the IDEOg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collecting information, and information from a child no less, is certainly sensitive and our team had multiple discussions on how our product would handle this responsibility. To address this, we made two key decisions. First, we decided that the product should not retain any information from the patients. Once the child is released from the hospital, the product should delete all information that it has collected. Second, we decided that the doctor is the only person who is able to see the data on the back-end and is only able to see the assumptions that the AI has made, not the raw data itself. Anything that the doctor would like to preserve, he or she must record that in the medical files manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/IDEO_prototype_with_google_home.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;prototype1&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;IDEOg at our demo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflection&quot;&gt;Reflection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was extremely proud of what my team was able to accomplish in one day and had a blast working with them. I was able to learn some of the frameworks used in human centered design, play around with new technologies, and tried my best to answer really difficult questions about the role that these technologies should play in future society. I would recommend future IDEO CoLab Makeathons to anyone interested in exploring emerging technologies and working on a team with incredibly talented people from a cross-section of fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jared Johnson</name></author><summary type="html">This past weekend, I participated in the IDEO CoLab Makeathon, where I was part of a team tasked with ideating, designing, and building a prototype in a single day.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Component Lifecycle Methods: Render Methods</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/08/14/component-life-cycle-methods.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Component Lifecycle Methods: Render Methods" /><published>2017-08-14T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2017/08/14/component-life-cycle-methods</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2017/08/14/component-life-cycle-methods.html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been building &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; projects for the last few weeks and I keep finding myself returning to the chart below (pulled from a lesson in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.co/&quot;&gt;Learn.co&lt;/a&gt; curriculum). It summarizes the inputs and use cases for the four Component Lifecycle Methods related to rendering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;componentWillReceiveProps&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;no&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;no&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;componentWillUpdate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;no&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;componentDidUpdate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;yes*&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;yes*&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Called when?&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Used for&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;componentWillReceiveProps&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;component is going to get new props&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;applying state changes&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;when a re-render has been triggered&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;deciding whether to re-render&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;componentWillUpdate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;new state and props are being received&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;dispatching actions based on state change&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;componentDidUpdate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;just after re-render&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;DOM updates following a render&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;componentDidUpdate&lt;/code&gt; will actually receive &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;prevProps&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;prevState&lt;/code&gt; as arguments, as the newly applied state and props can be accessed through &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this.props&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this.state&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And below is the order in which these methods are called, courtesy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/react-ecosystem/react-components-lifecycle-ce09239010df&quot;&gt;Osmel Mora&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/lifecycle1.png&quot; alt=&quot;render methods order&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This detail, alone, is worth a bookmark but in order to fully convince you, I shall elaborate. Let’s break down each of these methods. First up, we have &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;componentWillReceiveProps&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;componentwillreceiveprops&quot;&gt;componentWillReceiveProps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important point to make here is that each of these methods is called &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; a component has been mounted and thus &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; the initial render. Our first render method is called before a component receives new props. This guy won’t save you if you forget to write a default state or send initial props to your component. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;componentWillReceiveProps&lt;/code&gt; is a method that React gives you to deal with new props without triggering a state change (leading to an infinite loop). One of my code instructors argues that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;componentWillReceiveProps&lt;/code&gt; is the single most underutilized lifecycle method and I would agree given my own history of underutilizing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;componentWillReceiveProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nextProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;itemToBeUpdated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nextProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newInfoToUse&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the code example above, I am using my new props to update the state of my component. This will take place before the re-render has completed and should any display elements be controlled by what has changed in state, theses changes will be displayed to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shouldcomponentupdate&quot;&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is the odd one of the bunch, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/code&gt;. This function is different from the others in the component lifecycle in that it expects to return a boolean (and defaults to true). &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/code&gt; is used to tell React whether or not a re-render that has been triggered should be completed. This is useful when the developer is concerned with gating unnecessary rendering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;code example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nextProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nextState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nextState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code example above is taken from one of my projects. I wanted to update a controlled searchable dropdown list ONLY if the text that I was storing my state changed. Any other actions that trigger a re-render in this component will be blocked by my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;componentwillupdate&quot;&gt;componentWillUpdate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next function, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;componentWillUpdate&lt;/code&gt; is the last method called before a render takes place. This is our last opportunity to dispatch actions, so long as they do not attempt to push changes to our component state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;componentdidupdate&quot;&gt;componentDidUpdate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last render method, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;componentDidUpdate&lt;/code&gt; is called as soon as a re-render has completed. The primary use cases for this method are interacting with third-party libraries and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hosting-on-github-pages&quot;&gt;Hosting on Github Pages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to set my website up using &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. For those who aren’t familiar with GitHub, it’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub&quot;&gt;version control repository&lt;/a&gt; for code. What this means is that developers use it to preserve iterations of their projects and applications. It’s a great tool and for those new to programming, I highly recommend checking it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok so what is GitHub Pages? GitHub offers a relatively easy way for users to host projects and personal websites to the web for free. And you’re able to manage your website using the same workflow that you’ll be familiar with from working with code projects on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start using GitHub Pages for your website, the first think you will need to do is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/new&quot;&gt;create a repository&lt;/a&gt; with your GitHub username and the extension &lt;em&gt;‘.github.io’&lt;/em&gt; – it should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;your-username.github.io&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have this repository set up, the only file you need to create your website something called &lt;em&gt;index.html&lt;/em&gt;. I cloned my repository down locally and set my website up with it’s own directory but if these words mean nothing to you, I would recommend downloading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://central.github.com/mac/latest&quot;&gt;GitHub app&lt;/a&gt; to interface with your website repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a text editor like &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;, try typing &lt;em&gt;‘it’s my website’&lt;/em&gt; in your &lt;em&gt;index.html&lt;/em&gt; file and sending those changes up to GitHub using the code below if you’re using the terminal, or by syncing your changes if you are using the GitHub app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add .
git commit -m &quot;my first commit&quot;
git push
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now go to your-username.github.io in your browser and you should see something like this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/website1.png&quot; alt=&quot;your very own website!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your website is now live and you have the freedom to make it anything you want. Once I got to this point, I only partly felt satisfied. I have a functioning website but I have to type in the full &lt;em&gt;.github.io&lt;/em&gt; URL to access my site. Wouldn’t it be cooler if I could pull my website up with a snappy &lt;em&gt;‘.com’&lt;/em&gt; address? Well, you can be the judge of that but I knew my next step was to buy a domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;buying-and-setting-up-my-domain&quot;&gt;Buying and setting up my domain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing I did? High-tailed it to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.godaddy.com/&quot;&gt;GoDaddy.com&lt;/a&gt;. Dot com domain names can get pricey and I was lucky to find &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;jared-johnson.com&lt;/a&gt; at an affordable price (Although I did opt to pay a premium to insert a dash between my name rather than purchasing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jaredjohnson.net&quot;&gt;jaredjohnson.net&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jaredjohnson.us&quot;&gt;jaredjohnson.us&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get my GitHub site to be served to my fancy new domain name, I had to complete a few more steps. First, I had to let GitHub know that I was using a custom domain. In the ‘settings’ tab of your repository, you should find a box to enter a different URL (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/website2.png&quot; alt=&quot; custom domain box&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After letting GitHub know to serve your custom domain, you will need to let your DNS provider (GoDaddy in my case) know where to route your URL. I found a really helpful &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kswanie21/how-to-set-up-godaddy-domain-with-github-pages-a9300366c7b&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Kristen Swanson that details the steps needed to set this up if you are also using GoDaddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-the-site&quot;&gt;Building the site&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As awesome as it is to own a URL on the internet that just says “it’s my website,” I knew that I wanted to use my site for blogging. By now, I know enough programming to build something from scratch that looks good but my experience has also taught me just how much work can go into maintaining something as simple as a blog. Drawing routes for all my posts, formatting my plain text and designing my site in plain HTML/CSS was starting to look like a part-time job. That was until I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a static-site generator built by one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner&quot;&gt;co-founders&lt;/a&gt; of GitHub. Ok but what is a static-site generator? This just means that Jekyll is an application that can render all of the pages of your website from plain text and a template. Jekyll uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax&quot;&gt;Markdown Syntax&lt;/a&gt;, which is mostly plain text that renders to HTML, to tell your site what the contents of each page or post should be. It makes managing your site so much easier. With all of this said, understanding a little bit of HTML and CSS is extremely useful when using Jekyll, which I will demonstrate later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow me to show you an example to better hammer home why this is so useful and then I’ll discuss setting up Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what the Markdown syntax looks like for my last blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/website3.png&quot; alt=&quot;markdown syntax for my post&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this where my blog post content is pulled into my HMTL file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/website4.png&quot; alt=&quot;html template&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is rendered to my site to display like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/website5.png&quot; alt=&quot;blog post output&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have to set up a database or write logic that tells my site how to deal with each individual post. Following the convention of Jekyll projects, I was able to get my post content rendered to my site in minutes. Pretty cool, right? Now let’s discuss setting up Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup/Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a RubyGem. This means that, assuming you have a version of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; programming language installed on your machine, Jekyll can be installed using the following commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem install jekyll
jekyll new my-website
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now have a new Jekyll project at ‘my-website’ on your computer. Since I already have a working site via my GitHub pages repository, I moved all of the files that Jekyll gave me into the same folder. Now is a good time to discuss what these files are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File Structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# from the Jekyll official documentation
.
├── _config.yml
├── _layouts
|   ├── default.html
|   └── post.html
├── _posts
|   ├── 2017-07-02-quit-being-difficult.md
|   └── 2017-06-13-4-things-i-learned-toying-around-with-nested-resources-in-rails.md
├── _sass
|   └── _layout.scss
├── _site
└── index.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For simplicity, I’ve pared down the file tree example from the official Jekyll documentation. The first file that you should edit is &lt;em&gt;_config.yml&lt;/em&gt;, which is the configuration file that contains settings and variables that become available for use throughout your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;_layouts&lt;/em&gt; folder is where your page templates are stored. I am currently only using two different templates for my site, one for blog posts – &lt;em&gt;post.html&lt;/em&gt; – and another for my home page called &lt;em&gt;default.html&lt;/em&gt;. As I mentioned earlier, these templates are just HTML files that are populated with content from associated Markdown files (where you write your plain text). Content from your posts and variables defined in your &lt;em&gt;_config.yml&lt;/em&gt; file will be available to these templates using double brackets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New posts must follow a certain naming convention (see below) to be recognized by the Jekyll logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# post example in _posts folder
YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;‘.md’&lt;/em&gt; here denotes Markdown syntax. Anything I write in these files is sent through my &lt;em&gt;post.html&lt;/em&gt; template and a ready-to-serve HTML file is generated in my &lt;em&gt;_site&lt;/em&gt; folder. In the &lt;em&gt;_site&lt;/em&gt; folder lies the magic of Jekyll. All of the HTML files, images and CSS/styling elements used in my website are copied over or generated in this folder. As you make changes to your ‘.md’ files in your &lt;em&gt;_posts&lt;/em&gt; folder, the accompanying HMTL file in the &lt;em&gt;_site&lt;/em&gt; folder gets re-generated. With GitHub pages, the only thing I need to do after creating or editing a post is pushing my commits up to my repository. It’s that easy – No part-time job necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design/Layouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last that I want to touch on is using themes in Jekyll. Pre-made themes make it really easy to spin up a site that looks great in minutes. If you initialize your Jekyll project using the ‘jekyll new’ command, your site will come with a default theme named &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/minima&quot;&gt;minima&lt;/a&gt;. While this theme looks great, I wanted something even more pared down and swapped the theme for one called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal&quot;&gt;minimal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll makes changing your theme extremely easy. In your &lt;em&gt;config.yml&lt;/em&gt; file, you can swap out your theme for a number of options available in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=jekyll-theme&quot;&gt;RubyGems library&lt;/a&gt;. I narrowed my search by reviewing the list of themes &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/themes/&quot;&gt;supported by GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. Each theme comes with it’s own default template for pages, so I would recommend copying this over from the GitHub repository for your chosen theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely hope that this post has been helpful and that I’ve inspired you to create your own website. Don’t hesitate to reach out to me &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yungpanko&quot;&gt;@yungpanko&lt;/a&gt; if you have any questions about my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;functions in JavaScript form closures. A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical
environment within which that function was declared. (Mozilla Developer Network)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great. We can all go home now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…..I’m kidding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to look at some code but let’s break down what this definition is trying to tell us. &lt;em&gt;“a function is a closure”&lt;/em&gt; — cool — , and &lt;em&gt;“a closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.”&lt;/em&gt; This means that functions in JavaScript are more aware of their surrounding than functions or methods in other languages that do not have closures. JavaScript functions are familiar with the variables that exist in the environment where we create them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you employ the services of google to help you understand what a closure is, you will likely come across code examples with nested functions. There is a valid reason for this, as these functions help to demonstrate how different environments can change our closures, but the definition above explains that &lt;strong&gt;ALL&lt;/strong&gt; functions are closures. We don’t have to get fancy to explain what the hell this thing really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first example, I am declaring a variable, &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt;, with the value of my name. Then, I am writing a function, &lt;em&gt;printName&lt;/em&gt;, that console logs the name variable that I declared above it. If you test this out yourself, you will see that it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/qbd1.png&quot; alt=&quot;img1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may seem obvious that this works but — look closely — we never called our &lt;em&gt;printName&lt;/em&gt; function with an argument. What’s remarkable about what this function is doing is the very thing that makes it a closure. Our function was able to grab the name variable declared outside of itself, and within the global environment, to complete our operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;now-we-understand-what-a-closure-is-but-how-and-why-would-we-use-it&quot;&gt;Now we understand what a closure is but how and why would we use it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;private-methods-and-module-pattern&quot;&gt;Private methods and module pattern&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to cover two examples where your newfound understanding of closures can help. The first is private methods. A private method in JavaScript is a function that can only be accessed through another function. A quick example is below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/qbd2.png&quot; alt=&quot;img2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I have defined a function, &lt;em&gt;publicFunction&lt;/em&gt;, that returns another function, secretFunction. Both of these functions are closures, by definition, but only &lt;em&gt;publicFunction&lt;/em&gt; can be readily called by itself. When we try to console log our &lt;em&gt;secretFunction&lt;/em&gt;, we are told that it is not defined.
In &lt;em&gt;publicFunction&lt;/em&gt;, I have employed a syntax that will be familiar if you have dealt with objects in JavaScript. By writing the return for &lt;em&gt;publicFunction&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;“function name: function,”&lt;/em&gt; or in module pattern, we are able to call the inner function by chaining our call, similar to how we would retrieve attributes from an object. Let’s see that in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/qbd3.png&quot; alt=&quot;img3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript’s use of closures allows us to hide our secretFunction from the rest of our global scope and even reuse the name in other functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;partial-application-and-currying&quot;&gt;Partial application and currying&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding closures is also important for understanding the mechanics of partial application and currying. When we pass arguments into functions that return functions, our return functions, or closures, are aware of these arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s examine the code below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/qbd4.png&quot; alt=&quot;img4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I am defining a function, &lt;em&gt;multiplyNumbers&lt;/em&gt;, that accepts two numbers and returns their product. I have written this function to return another function in the case that it only receives one argument. This return function, or closure, can access the first variable that we gave our outer function, &lt;em&gt;multiplyNumbers&lt;/em&gt;, and complete our operation. At the bottom of the screenshot, you can see that both ways (passing both arguments into the outer function AND passing the first argument to the outer function and the second to the inner function) return the same result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can supply our outer function only one argument and name the resulting function (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/qbd5.png&quot; alt=&quot;img5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the power of closures truly shines here. Our named methods, &lt;em&gt;multiplyByFive&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;multiplyByFour&lt;/em&gt;, were birthed by the same function, &lt;em&gt;multiplyNumbers&lt;/em&gt;. They only differ in the environment scope that they refer to. The first argument for &lt;em&gt;multiplyByFive&lt;/em&gt; is still 5, even after the creation of an additional function, &lt;em&gt;multiplyByFour&lt;/em&gt;, that takes in a different first argument. Pretty cool, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this. I hope you’ve learned that functions in JavaScript can be more than meets the eye. Below are additional resources on closures and how understanding them becomes useful in functional programming.&lt;/p&gt;
